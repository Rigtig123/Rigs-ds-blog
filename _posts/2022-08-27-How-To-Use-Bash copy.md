## How I used Bash to Create a Juypter Notebook

First, I created a bash notebook by selecting  a New Notebook under the file menu and the sub-item allowed me  to choose the notebook type as in diagram 2. The bash notebook I learned, is very similar to the Python one. I entered some code that I did in the NBA Trivia Post within a new cell and pressed Ctrl-Return to run the code.

Vocabulary List
print: used to output a message on the screen. For example, print(“Hello!”) output: Hello! You only use quotations for string, which are words.
def: used to identify a function
input: used to take an input from the user. Input taken from the user will be converted into a string ex: input(“Enter value: “) Enter value: 1 ‘1’
variable: used to input or is considered a space for a word. For example, msg = "hi" and then I did print(msg) it will output "hi"
